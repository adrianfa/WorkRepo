				<h3>This is a APT project</h3>
				<p>This is a APT project. Its intention is to find a parking solution that incorporates 
				mobile and web application. The solution takes into account the three major players: the driver that parks his car
				the private parking spot owner, who wants cheap and immediately controllable management of his parking spaces, 
				and a solution for the person to check the valid or invalid occupancy of the private parking 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Prototype Only</h3>
				<p>This work is currently at prototype level only. There are several extensions we planned to add to this work. One relates to the payment method.
				
				</p>
				
				<h3>Payment Method Extension</h3>
				<p>There are at least three different payment methods we consider incorporating. The other one is in relation to the identification of the parking lot
				to which the parking I am using belongs to. For now we implemented the QR reading, being a safe and easy to use solution.</p>
				
				<h3>Identify parking </h3>
		        <p>
				There would be two 
				alternative solutions considered, using GPS to locate it on the map and ask the driver for acknowledgment, and the other one to simply provide 
				the address of the parking and "guess" it from a list of parking. The alternative solutions would be valuable the more owners would use this solution.</p>
	
				<h3>Automatic Occupancy Validation </h3>
		        <p>
				The third issue regard the enforcement. There are wonderful opportunities to automatically checking the occupancy and the validity of that occupancy. They would 
				require minimal HW installation and, using automatic image analysis, it would validate the occupancy.  </p>
